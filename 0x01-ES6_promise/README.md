Overview
This repository contains solutions to tasks related to ES6 Promises in JavaScript. Each task is designed to help you understand and practice concepts such as Promises, asynchronous programming, error handling, and more.

Introduction
ES6 Promises provide a way to deal with asynchronous operations in JavaScript. Promises represent a value that may be available now, in the future, or never. They allow you to handle asynchronous operations in a more elegant and manageable way compared to traditional callback-based approaches.
