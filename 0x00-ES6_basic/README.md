# ES6 Basics Project

This project focuses on mastering ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) concepts and features in JavaScript. It covers various topics such as const and let declarations, arrow functions, default parameters, rest and spread parameters, string templating, object creation, iterators, and for-of loops.

## Description

The project contains a series of tasks aimed at understanding and implementing various ES6 concepts in JavaScript. Each task is accompanied by detailed instructions and requirements.

## Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js 12.11.x in your environment.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
5. You're now ready to work on the tasks.

## Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on a specific ES6 concept. Here's a brief overview of the tasks:

1. **Const or let?**: Modify variables using `const` and `let` declarations.
2. **Block Scope**: Adjust variable scopes to avoid overwriting within conditional blocks.
3. **Arrow Functions**: Rewrite functions using ES6 arrow function syntax.
4. **Parameter Defaults**: Condense function internals using default parameter values.
5. **Rest Parameter Syntax**: Modify functions to utilize the rest parameter syntax.
6. **Spread Syntax**: Concatenate arrays and strings using spread syntax.
7. **Template Literals**: Utilize template literals for string interpolation.
8. **Object Property Shorthand**: Simplify object creation using property shorthand syntax.
9. **Computed Property Names**: Use computed property names for object properties.
10. **ES6 Method Properties**: Rewrite objects to utilize ES6 method properties.
11. **For...of Loops**: Rewrite loops using ES6's `for...of` syntax.
12. **Iterator**: Create an iterator object to iterate through employees.
13. **Iterate through Object**: Implement a function to iterate through an object's properties.
14. **Iterate through report object**: Write a function to iterate through a report object and return employee names.

Each task has its own directory and associated files containing implementation and test cases.

## Usage

To execute each task, navigate to its directory and run the corresponding test script. For example, to run the tests for Task 1, navigate to the `0x00-ES6_basic/0x00-ES6_basic/0-constants.js` directory and execute the test script.

```bash
npm run dev <test-script>
